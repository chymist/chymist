# Chymist
### Synthesizing ideas in biology

Chymist is a graph-powered idea serialization system, tuned for biology.
Complicated sets of relations and connections between seperate parts of a system
are hard to hold in one's head for long. One field especially susceptible to this
is *biology*, specifically molecular or chemical biology.
The complicated metabolic, regulatory, and signalling pathways involved are incredibly complex.
When investigating the prior art of literature on a subject, and trying to hold pathways and
systems that you have read about in your head, you're bound to lose some connections.
Chymist is software for *serializing*, or "writing down", these connections and ideas.
