# The Chymist contributor code of conduct
Yeah, so, shit happens and people end up having problems with other contributors.
Unfortunately, we live in a world where there are plenty of biased, horrible people.
Since we (the Chymist project team) would rather work on technical problems
and have fun with those rather than mediate disputes and throw water on metaphorical fires, we have this code of conduct.

## WHAT YOU MUST DO (hint: be a decent person)
We **WILL NOT TOLERATE** any of the following:
 * Trolling.
 * Being insulting, demeaning, or derogatory.
 * Personal *("ad hominem")* attacks.
 * Doxxing people who wish to remain anonymous.
 * Harrassment of any kind.
 * Sexualized language/imagery or unwanted and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
 * Any other similar behaviors considered unprofessional to be determined at our discretion.

## WHAT WE'LL DO TO YOU IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE ABOVE
Since we're pretty much masters of this tiny universe, we're going to delete anything
that gets posted that doesn't respect the above. If you cross a line and start threatening people
or being a piece of work to other contributors on a regular basis, you're getting the boot. Bye.

If you're being harassed in connection with this project, shoot off
an email to the team (since we don't actually have an email, just send one to the project lead's first name (at) cpan (dot) org).
We take reports of harassment or threats very seriously and will try to respond ASAP:
harassment reports are *far* higher priority than technical correspondence.
In addition, we maintain strict confidentiality with respect to any
incidents and the people who report them.

### Where exactly does this apply?
Everywhere connected to the project: On Github, in IRC, in mailing lists,
AFK at conventions if you're representing us, etc.
